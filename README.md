# Integrative analysis of multi-omic data in AD through supervised graph-guided Bayesian factor analysis (submitted)
Qiyiwen Zhang, Changgee Chang, Chong Jin, Li Shen & Qi Long

## Abstract 
We develop a set of novel priors that enable incorporation of biologi-
cal graph knowledge and identification of both active modalities and features
through two-level adaptive shrinkage, improving the biological interpretation
of results. The proposed method is fairly robust to noisy edges in biological
graphs that are inconsistent with ground truth, a common scenario in practice.

## Code Description
- KEGG.R contains the function to construct the gene regulatory network extracted from KEGG.
- build_graph.R contains the sample code to construct the gene regulatory network. 
- data_generate.R contains the R code to generate the synthetic data.
- example.R contains the example code for the model implementation and model selection. 
- sGBFA.R contain the main function for the model RABFA.
